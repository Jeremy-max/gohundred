      Kalau yang kemarin jam 16.00 wib nontonin kegiatan Campaign.com bareng @wastehub.id di Zoom pasti tahu kalau kita mengalami apa yang disebut dengan #Zoombombing. Gak cuma Champ aja yang terkejut, kita semuanya juga!\n
      \n
      Tapi dari pengalaman tersebut, kita sadar bahwa kejadian serupa pasti dialami juga oleh banyak orang di luar sana. Dan menjadi bukti betapa hebatnya komunitas yang kita bentuk. Apapun yang terjadi, tidak menjadi halangan bagi kita semua dalam melakukan aksi baik dan menyebarkan pesan-pesan positif demi menciptakan ruang online yang lebih aman untuk semua. \n
      \n
      Kita juga ingin meminta maaf atas kejadian kemarin yang menghambat kegiatan sehingga tidak sesuai dengan rencana awalnya. Maka dari itu, Champ & Campaign.com membagikan tips yang bisa dilakukan untuk mengantisipasi tindak kejahatan #Zoombombing yang  bisa kamu lihat pada poster di atas.\n
      \n
      Kalau kamu punya tips lainnya bisa dibagikan pada kolom komentar ya!

      #Changemakers, kalian tau gak ternyata menurut BAPPENAS per 2018, Indonesia berada di posisi kedua sebagai negara produsen sampah makanan terbesar di dunia loh. Rata-rata orang di Indonesia menyumbang 300kg sampah makanan yang terbuang setiap tahunnya.\n
       \n
      “Banyak banget yaa. Dengan angka sebanyak itu, makanannya pada kemana sih?”\n
       \n
      Jawabannya adalah menjadi sampah, yang dikenal dengan istilah food waste. Sampah jenis ini jika tidak dikelola dengan baik dapat menghasilkan gas methana yang berpotensi menyebabkan ledakan.\n
       \n
      “Ledakannya besar Champ?”\n
       \n
      Dilansir dari lifestyle.bisnis.com, pada tahun 2005, sempat terjadi ledakan di TPA Leuwigajah, Cimahi, Jawa Barat. Ledakan ini menelan 157 korban jiwa dan 2 desa hilang tergulung longsoran sampah. Jadi, kamu bisa ukur sendiri seberapa besar ledakan yang dihasilkan oleh gas methana, hasil dari sampah makanan yang tidak terkelola dengan baik.\n
       \n
      Sebenarnya untuk meminimalisir food waste mudah saja kok #Changemakers. Mulai dari diri kamu sendiri aja dulu. Jangan ambil makanan terlalu banyak hingga membuat makanan tersebut gak habis dan menyisakan sampah makanan, kamu juga bisa menanam bahan makanan yang sudah tidak dapat dimakan lagi, tinggal ambil bijinya lalu tanam deh.\n
       \n
      Nah Wonder Food Indonesia mengajak kita semua dalam meningkatkan awareness masyarakat terhadap isu food waste di Indonesia melalui tantangan #FoodIsLove di aplikasi Campaign #ForChange loh.

      #Changemakers, sudah pada tahu kan kalau di Indonesia konsumsi plastik sekali pakai tuh masih tinggi banget. Sudah gitu, banyak sekali sampah plastik yang tidak didaur ulang sehingga berakhir di laut kita, sehingga membahayakan biota laut.\n

      Hal ini, secara tidak langsung dapat membahayakan kita jika mengkonsumsi hidangan laut. Dan ini berdasarkan sampel darah kering yang diambil dari kerang biru oleh Mark Browne.

Hal ini menggambarkan bahwa satwa laut secara tidak langsung membawa potongan-potongan plastik yang mana ketika kita konsumsi dapat membahayakan tubuh kita.\n

      ADAM SCHIFF'S "BEWARE OF THE IDES OF MARCH" CLOSING IMPEACHMENT SPEECH CONFIRMS HE'S A SOOTHSAYER.\n
      It was not until the middle of March 2020 that President Pandemic announced social distancing -- TWO WEEKS TOO LATE TO SAVE 90 PERCENT OF THE CURRENT DEAD! If Virus-in-Chief had announced a social distancing order ON OR BEFORE MARCH 2, coronavirus deaths would still be UNDER 10,000, and the economy would be intact.\n
      What Trump has done in the last five months merits a Congressman Adam Schiff "TOLD YOU SO" TOUR of all major networks, late night shows, and other info-disseminators.\n
      "Adam Schiff and His Colleagues Did Their Duty in the Trump Impeachment Trial" The New Yorker 1/25/2020\n
      "From the beginning and throughout the trial, Schiff urged senators not to lose sight of the bigger picture. Late on Thursday night, he noted that Trump’s effort to extort Ukraine wasn’t a one-off: it fit into a pattern of the President putting his own interests ahead of the country, a pattern that would continue if he were allowed to remain in office. “You may be asking, how much damage can he really do in the next several months until the election? A lot. A lot of damage,” Schiff said. “This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters and truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.” \n
      \n
      BUZZ KILL AFTER TRIAL: CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS, IS THERE A GAG ORDER?\n
      At the time when Congressional Democrats should have been most vocal, they hit the mute button, and they are allowed a mentally unstable pathological falsehood factory and disinformation station to dominate the minds of voters, and purge the intelligence community with little or no rapid retorts. If they are under the impression that "the American people know he's lying", I would snap back, "NO THEY DO NOT". NOT ALL VOTERS KNOW TRUMP IS THIS NATION'S NATIONAL SECURITY NIGHTMARE.\n
      \n
      AS A POWER OF ONE, CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS SHOULD HAVE BEEN BULLHORNS ATTACKING TRUMP'S FURTHER ABUSES AND DEFENDING WHISTLEBLOWERS. THEY DIDN'T BUT MUST START NOW.\n
      \n
      "Trump is busily inciting people across the country — and especially in swing states — to ignore public health guidance on limiting the spread of covid-19 and resume socializing and working in the riskiest of ways. Modeling masklessness, he welcomes any sabotage of orderly reopening. “The place is bustling!” he exulted, after Wisconsin’s Supreme Court struck down stay-at-home orders.\n
      \n
      Such recklessness, in defiance of his own administration’s guidance, risks igniting new waves of the disease. That could lead not only to thousands more deaths but also to further devastation of the economy. It’s not far-fetched to think that this blowback could arrive with the cooler weather next fall — just as people are voting in the presidential election."\n
      \n
      ESTABLISH, AMPLIFY, AND MAINTAIN NARRATIVES THAT ERODE TRUST IN TRUMP'S DISINFORMATION.\n
      One top list narrative must be Trump's consistent habit of committing acts of crime or wrong-doing to further his political agenda such as election and re-election. Since the 2016 campaign, Trump has openly accepted assistance from a foreign aggressor who was currently known at the time to be undermining the election process and was also directly involved in the Hush Money campaign felony - both of which were committed in an effort to win an election. His material lie about Trump Tower Moscow (not existing) factored into the result as well.\n
      \n
      In July 2017, Putin conspired with (or duped) Trump into amplifying a Russian fabricated conspiracy theory designed to blame and frame Ukraine for the 2016 election meddling, and a DNC server hidden in the same country. Biden was also added to the hit list as Trump recycled the 2016 Russian meddling strategy for 2020. The impeachment followed the discovery.\n
      \n
      Then Trump attempted to downplay, if not coverup, an inevitable pandemic with one primary motive; preserve his re-election prospects. His election oriented decision-making resulted in the worst and most deadly response to a pandemic that could have spared 90 percent of the current dead if his mind was not clouded with self-interest. Yes, America, tens of thousands died because Trump saw the pandemic as a threat to his re-election rather than a national security crisis he was duty-bound to address. \n
      \n
      THESIS OF NARRATIVE: TRUMP'S VIOLATION OF LAWS, INVOLVEMENT IN WRONG-DOING, AND SELF-CENTERED DECISIONS DURING A NATIONAL CRISIS WERE ALL MOTIVATED BY TRUMP'S DANGEROUS OBSESSION TO BE RE-ELECTED TO AN OFFICE HE IS TOO CORRUPT AND BLATANTLY UNQUALIFIED TO HOLD.\n

      LET’S ALL REMEMBER THAT “CUTS” TO CDC REAPED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DEAD PEOPLE, AND GRENELL HAS ZERO INTELLIGENCE EXPERIENCE.\n
      “Congressional Democrats were upset that they were not consulted before the changes. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said they would have to examine the details of the reorganization to “evaluate the wisdom of these cuts.”\n
      The National Counterterrorism Center “plays a critical role in fighting terrorism and keeping Americans safe,” Mr. Warner said, adding that “we need to make sure that it continues to work as Congress intended, regardless of what the acting D.N.I. decides to do while he’s temporarily in the job.”\n
      Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that the center “was created in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, and preventing another catastrophic attack remains among our nation’s most solemn obligations.”\n
      “Many recent former NCTC leaders expressed concerns about the potential for politicized changes” to it, he added, using an acronym for the center.”\n

      TIME FOR HOUSE TO REBUKE IF NOT CENSURE TRUMP FOR THE FOLLOWING: [rough draft]\n
      [FREQUENT PUBLIC DISCLOSURE (SHAMING( OF TRUMP CORRUPTION IS ESSENTIAL, AND WORTH A PRESS CONFERENCE. Many voters may not be aware that his actions are violations of law or unethical.] Otherwise, why would he stop?\n
      \n
      1. Liberal use of impeachable strategies described in Richard Nixon’s Article Two Number Six Impeachment, which states: “In disregard of the rule of law, [Trump] Nixon knowingly misused the executive power by interfering with agencies of the executive branch, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Criminal Division, and the [tampering and misrepresentation of the Mueller Report from the special counsel], of the Department of Justice, and the Central Intelligence Agency, in violation of his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\n
      In all of this, [Donald J. Trump] Nixon acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\n
      Wherefore Donald J. Trump, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.”\n
      2. Liberal use of impeachable strategies described in Richard Nixon’s Article Two Number Four of Impeachment, which states, “He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, in violation or disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens, authorized and permitted to be maintained a secret investigative unit within the office of the President, financed in part with money derived from campaign contributions, which unlawfully utilized the resources of the Central Intelligence Agency, engaged in covert and unlawful activities, and attempted to prejudice the constitutional right of an accused to a fair trial.” Or in the case of Michael Cohen, a just release from prison due to coronavirus concerns. Also, in the case of former Obama administration officials all of whom were authorized to unmask criminal Michael Flynn who was caught negotiating Russian sanctions relief for exchange of Russia’s successful assistance in the election of President Donald J. Trump - who was funneled stolen information from a political opponent through Roger Stone from Russian supported Wikileaks.\n
      3. Obstructing life saving measures prior to March 2: The last day before 9 of 10 coronavirus deaths were preventable. Trump canceled a critical World threat assessment scheduled for February 12. If Congress had received that assessment, tens of thousands of lives could have been saved.\n
      4. Ignoring the warnings of White House economists, intelligence briefings, and CDC personnel because their information threatened the stock market numbers and replace-election.\n
      5. Pre-meditated misuse of authority prefaced by firing DNI inspector generals so Trump could misuse his office to distribute money in an inequitable corrupt manner.\n
      6. Firing State Department Inspector General for investigating misuse of Human Resources by Pompeo.\n
      7. Inappropriate appointments of inexperienced and unqualified coronavirus supply distribution that was blatantly a Deep State crony driver favoritism scam that disproportionately favored Trump allies over state needs.\n
      8. The firing, censoring, and misrepresentation of CDC and other medical experts, which consequently endangered the lives of Americans for self-interests at odds with the reality of the crisis.\n
      9. Refusing to distribute the original CDC guidelines to open the economy with American lives as a priority over economy, and replacing the guidelines more amenable to economy over lives.\n
      10. Press conferences with frequent misrepresentations and disinformation that placed American lives in unnecessary risks.\n
      11. Endangering the lives of protesters, law enforcement, medical personnel, and government officials for self-serving political purposes.\n
      12. Placing this nation at risk by the purging and removal of experienced and qualified intelligence community personnel as a preface to abuse Presidential and DNI authority for self-interest and self-preservation purposes not related to national security of the United States. Attempting to restructure the intelligence apparatus in a criminally driven manner that places the United States in a compromised position against foreign aggressors.\n
      13. Misuse of Presidential authority and Attorney General authority to disrupt and deconstruct federal investigations related to the Russia investigation with a criminal effort to revise definitive conclusions and fabricate excuses for the release of criminal suspects or the removal of charges against Russian actors who meddled in the 2016 presidential election for self-serving purposes that were threaten the national security of the United States of America.\n
      14. Frequent use of impeachable actions described in President Richard Nixon’s articles of impeachment, which still merit impeachment. Misuse of multiple agencies to unjustly pursue fabricated violations in a manner identical to impeachable acts described in President Nixon’s articles of impeachment.\n
      15. A continued effort to suppress evidence that is disclosed in books, such as John, whose past due publication describes blatant acts of corruption that endanger the national security of the United States for personal and self-enrichment purposes. Such violations described include “doing favors for autocrats” by tampering with investigations related to the autocrat and Trump self-interests.\n
      16. The appointment of a completely unqualified inexperienced DNI with nefarious motives, which makes Richard Grenell the second most critical threat to national security (after President Trump. AG Barr is ranked third threat) since his acts confirm his gutting and reshaping of the intelligence community is analogous to Trump’s gutting and reshaping if the CDC which has resulted in a disastrous response accountable for tens of thousands of preventable deaths. \n

      \n
      Hundreds watched as the men incarcerated at the Mississippi State Penitentiary (Parchman) pled for their lives and for help as violence unfolded at the end of 2019. Videos were circulated that detailed the horrific conditions that exist at Parchman. Unfortunately, what we all witnessed is not an anomaly that is only taking place in Mississippi prisons. Prisoners in facilities across the U.S. are living in deplorable, unsanitary conditions without access to medical and mental health care. \n
      \n
      This in unacceptable under any circumstances but during a global health pandemic, these conditions are a potential death sentence. What is happening in Parchman is happening in other prisons across the state of Mississippi and across this nation. Parchman is everywhere. We hope you will join us to discuss these important issues. It is a matter of life or death.\n

      Today is International Day of Families, and we're thinking about the Syrian families who can’t be together. Our colleague Ameenah wrote: \n
      \n
      “I come from a big family and I remember all the times we were gathered at the table, being loud, laughing and talking at the same time. My mother is a great cook, she learnt it from her mother, and she would ask what everyone wished for and then cook dishes for all of us. Family for us was and still means everything.” \n
      \n
      “My uncle was the first one to go missing. One day his house was raided and he was arrested barefoot in his pajamas in the cold. We tried to stop the intelligence forces from taking him, but ended up being beaten up ourselves. That was only the beginning. My father, my brother, my other uncle, and many cousins were forcefully taken and disappeared into the detention centres of the Assad regime.”  \n
      \n
      “After six years we still know nothing about their whereabouts, but like all families we need to know what happened to our loved ones to be complete again. Now for me, a decorated dish of tabbouleh salad is horrifying and annoying. It is my brother Muhammad's favourite food, who has been detained for six years. “My mom's tabbouleh is the best in the whole world!” Muhammad always used to say. My mom tells me she won’t make it until he is back.” \n
      \n
      “I live in Berlin now and I am always on the lookout for those who have tasted loss – who might understand why I panic over fresh tomatoes and avoid buying parsley and smelling the ingredients of tabbouleh all over the house.”\n
      \n
      “It is too late to change anything in my story, but for so many families who are living through danger, trauma, and displacement, there is still a lot that can be done. For my family and so many Syrian families, we can’t change the past but we will always hold the world responsible until we have justice and accountability for our families.” \n

      “The World Health Organization (WHO) hasn’t delivered $1 to Idlib for its coronavirus response. It hasn’t given health facilities in northwest Syria a single bed to receive coronavirus patients. We know there are logistical problems in receiving ventilators globally, but what about oxygen generators and patient beds?" \n
      \n
      "When the WHO makes promises to deliver aid to the people of Idlib, other donors think that they’re taking the lead. But after months of promises, the WHO hasn’t responded with a single dollar and they haven’t delivered any resources. The WHO has a real problem in northwest Syria.”\n
       \n
      Today Dr Munzer al-Khalil, the head of مديرية صحة إدلب - Idlib Health Directorate, delivered a stark message to the World Health Organisation in a webinar hosted by Chatham House and The Syria Campaign on the risks of coronavirus in Idlib. \n
       \n
      “Idlib has just 47 adult ventilators and they are 100% occupied most of the time. We don’t have one available ventilator that’s ready to receive corona patients, yet there is no clear deadline for when the WHO is going to deliver on its promises.”\n
       \n
      “The WHO is sending all their aid via the regime in Damascus, but we remember when the regime attacked our hospitals and killed our medical staff. We remember when it cut polio vaccinations for our children in 2012 so that polio would appear again in northwest Syria, as a weapon to punish people.”\n
       \n
      “We have a good relationship with our fellow doctors in Damascus and we know that there are a lot more coronavirus cases than the regime is publicising. There is no trust to work with the regime. If the WHO does want us to deal with Damascus, they have to be clear with us that that’s their plan, but they aren’t transparent and they don’t even tell us their plan.”\n
       \n
      Also on the panel was Raed al-Saleh, leader of the Syria Civil Defence - The White Helmets. He also criticised the WHO’s coronavirus response in Idlib:\n
       \n
      “The way the WHO delivers assistance is not impartial or balanced. They prioritise regime controlled areas. We aren’t against the WHO assisting our brothers and sisters in regime controlled areas, but we believe aid should be delivered on a needs basis and balanced across areas that need it.”\n
       \n
      “The bureaucracy of the WHO when it comes to emergency responses is a big challenge. The WHO announced a coronavirus taskforce for Idlib in early March, but we’re approaching the end of April and nothing practical has been delivered, while our people on the ground are waiting.”\n
       \n
      The webinar also covered the emerging risks to children in Idlib, laid out by Alaa Rajaa Mughrabieh from the  Syrian child protection network, Syria’s leading child protection NGO: \n
       \n
      “Children in North West Syria have already gone through so much. Prior to coronavirus, a million people, over half of them children, were displaced from their homes by months of intense shelling. Schools had only just opened again after the ceasefire when coronavirus emerged and schools had to shut again.” \n
      \n
      “There needs to be real investment in smaller organizations that are already operating successfully and which have built relationships of trust with their communities and authorities. Syrian civil society can produce results during and after an outbreak crisis.”\n

      UPDATE ON IDLIB\n
      \n
      The situation in Idlib has reached a horrifying level with close to one million people forced to flee Syrian regime and Russian bombs in just 40 day. Displacement camps along the border with Turkey are overcrowded and people are left with no option but to sleep in the open, in their cards on the roadside and in unfinished buildings. Several children have died in the cold.\n
      \n
      Assad’s and Putin’s forces continue to advance in the province, forcing residents to flee one village after another while claiming victory over the ruins of people’s homes. \n
      \n
      This is the biggest humanitarian disaster Syria has seen in the past nine years and it’s devastating every aspect of life for the 3.5 million civilians in Idlib. Just in February, nine medical facilities and three displacement camps have been deliberately targeted, which are clear war crimes. Schools have been forced to suspend their operations, putting half a million children out of school. \n
      \n
      Under the most dangerous conditions, the White Helmets continue to do everything they can to save every life they can. They have pulled 350 civilians from under the rubble since February 1 and helped evacuate hundreds of fleeing families to safer areas. \n
      \n
      Brave journalists and activists on the ground are sharing daily updates, calling on everyone to bear witness and to speak up for Idlib.\n
      \n
      In the face of this horror, the world's most powerful countries and institutions have utterly abandoned Syrian civilians. There is no plan for nearly 1 million displaced people who are squeezed into a shrinking area between the Turkish border and the front line as the regime continues to advance. \n

      \n
      “Once again, the Syrian regime bombs Idlib city, threatening the lives of millions of civilians. 12 people were killed and 22 others injured so far, by air raids that targeted the city center and the industrial zone. Our White Helmets teams continue their rescue operations.\n
      \n
      “More than 35 civilians were killed in the past 48 hours in Aleppo and Idlib while bombing continues”.\n

      Fatima Haj Mousa, a journalist from Atareb who had to flee with her family last night, said: “Last night, Atareb was being bombed heavily by the regime and Russia, families were escaping on foot, motorcycles or in cars. The roads were also being targeted. Three people were killed and many injured on their way out. We fled our home and had to turn off our car’s lights so the warplanes won’t spot us. It was dark and really cold.”\n

      I can only give you DATES and ACTIONS so YOU can make up your OWN MIND....\n
      \n
      Lets start with what country HATES AMERICA THE MOST?\n
      CHINA!  Our president has EXPOSED how they have "RAPED" America for DECADES on TRADE and, EXPOSED how BEHOLDING WE are to COMMUNIST CHINA.....\n
      THEN\n
      WHO HATES AMERICA NEXT AFTER CHINA?\n
      EUROPE....Our President ALSO EXPOSED how they have ALSO "RAPED" our country with UNFAIR TRADE DEALS....\n
      He's also pulled us out of the Paris Climate agreement, WHERE WE FOOTED MOST OF THE BILL and GOT NOTHING IN RETURN...\n
      HE also have made countries START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE to belong to the UNITED NATIONS....\n
      THEY DON'T LIKE THAT EITHER!!!  THEY ARE REALLY TICKED OFF!!!!\n
      SO,\n
      BOTH CHINA and EUROPE have been SHAKEN TO THEIR CORE because TRUMP EXPOSED THEM...THEY WERE GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER for DECADES....\n
      OH, there are PLENTY of other countries that HATE US, COUNTRIES THAT WE GIVE BILLIONS of DOLLARS TO while they BURN our FLAG and CHANT "DEATH TO AMERICA"..\n
      AND THEY ARE LIVID that \n
      OUR PRESIDENT SAID:  "NOPE, NO MORE, NOT ON MY WATCH"!!!\n
      \n
      THE WORLD HAS BEEN HOPING for TRUMP to be TAKEN OUT OF OFFICE ever since won...They were actually rooting for the DEMOCRATS proving that Trump was a RUSSIAN AGENT and that he would be DRUG off to jail...\n
      WHY???  The reason is simple...\n
      THEY WERE PETRIFIED that HE would FOLLOW THROUGH with his campaign promises and DRAIN THE SWAMP...\n
      AND\n
      WHO WAS EVEN more PETRIFIED than the COUNTRIES of the world????\n
      THE DEMOCRATS!!!!\n
      SO, \n
      THAT TOOK 3 YEARS and MILLIONS of dollars, AND THEY FAILED....\n
      SO,\n
      THEIR NEXT STEP WAS IMPEACHMENT....WHICH ALSO FAILED!!!\n
      It's FUNNY HOW THAT WORKS when you have the TRUTH on your SIDE!!!\n
      \n
      We all have witnessed the ALMOST 4 YEARS of the DEMOCRAT PARTY do everything IN THEIR POWER to YANK TRUMP out of OFFICE....\n
      I don't need to go over ALL the times BECAUSE there are way too many and this column would be MUCH LONGER....\n
      BUT\n
      THAT ENTIRE, CORRUPT PARTY, along with MAXINE WATTERS was constantly screaming "IMPEACH FORDA FI, IMPEACH FORDA FI"...(Maxine's version of Impeach forty five)\n
      \n
      FACTS DON'T LIE!!!\n
      WE'VE all seen the HATE from the LEFT....the INTIMIDATION TACTICS THEY'VE USED....THEY NOT ONLY HATE our PRESIDENT, THEY HATE US FOR VOTING FOR HIM!!!!\n
       \n
      I've combined SOME of the dates from my post back in March and the dates AND ACTIONS that I posted 5/20 and it's all very telling... \n
      AND\n
      BASED on these dates, ACTIONS and WHO took those actions, my theory about this PANDEMIC has been reinforced MORE and MORE, EVERY SINGLE DAY...\n
      \n
      HERE IS A CURIOUS TIMELINE:\n
      \n
      12/18/2019 - President Trump was IMPEACHED..\n
      \n
      THINGS were GETTING VERY, VERY BAD in HONG KONG..\n
      THEN\n
       ABRACADABRA, \n
      12/31/2019 - The world health organization is INFORMED that people in WUHAN, CHINA, are coming down with pneumonia due to an UNKNOWN CAUSE.....\n
      \n
      1/3/2020 - CDC Director Robert Redfield sent an email to the director of the Chinese CDC, George Gao, formally offering to send U.S. experts to China to investigate the coronavirus. THEY REFUSED!\n
      \n
      1/5/2020 -  CDC Director Redfield sent ANOTHER EMAIL to the Chinese CDC Director, George Gao, formally offering to send U.S. experts to China to investigate the coronavirus outbreak, THEY REFUSED!\n
      \n
      1/8/2020 - "A Severe respiratory disease associated with a novel infectious agent" was proclaimed by Hong Kong's center for health protection....\n
      AND WHAT HAPPENED???\n
      Travel was RESTRICTED  in Wuhan, BUT ALLOWED THOUSANDS if not MILLIONS, corona virus  INFECTED humans were ALLOWED to COME TO AMERICA.....\n
      Now remember, the CDC TRIED TO SEND a TEAM to help 1/3/2020 and again 1/5/2020 and THEY REFUSED...\n
      WHY WOULD THEY REFUSE, you ask??\n
      SIMPLE, they didn't want the TRUTH to come OUT, that THIS VIRUS was MADE in their LAB....\n
      THEY NOT ONLY KNEW how CONTAGIOUS it was, BUT DIDN'T WANT HELP to STOP IT....THIS WAS THEIR ACE in the HOLE, in case Trump was ACQUITTED.....\n
      \n
      JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THESE DATES:\n
      \n
      1/14/2020 - W.H.O. said CORNAVIRUS was NOT CONTAGIOUS among HUMANS...\n
      \n
      1/30/2020 - BOTH Azar and FAUCI said the RISK TO AMERICA is low and people shouldn't be afraid of getting on a plane or going to the SUPERBOWL...\n
      \n
      1/31/2020 - IN SPITE of the W.H.O, Azar and FAUCI and IN SPITE of being called a RACIST and a XENOPHOBE by the DEMOCRATS, TRUMP announced CHINA TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS...\n
      Again, notice NO HELP FROM DEMOCRATS, just their NORMAL, CONSTANT NAME CALLING....\n
      \n
      2/4/2020- President Trump vowed, in his state of the union address to take ALL NECESSARY STEPS to protect AMERICANS from the CORONA VIRUS...\n
      \n
      For the ENITRE MONTH of FEBRUARY Trump worked endlessly to CURB the PANDEMIC....(see my previous post for exact dates WITH links to verify all dates)\n
      \n
      2/5/2020 - President Trump was ACQUITTED.....\n
      2/5/2020 - THE DEMOCRATS LOST THEIR MINDS.....AGAIN.....actually, WHAT'S NEW!\n
      2/6/2020 - THE DEMS were running around with their HAIR ON FIRE... ENDLESSLY BERATING TRUMP.....TRYING TO UNDERMINE EVERYTHING he was TRYING TO DO TO PROTECT US...\n
      AGAIN, what's new!\n
      \n
      2/24/2020 - Nancy DEMTIA-LOSI was in CHINATOWN telling people to COME ON DOWN...".It's SAFE,,,we are all here..so come on down and JOIN US...."\n
      \n
      2/25/2020 - Louisiana's Governor, John Bel Edwards (D) and the Mayor of New Orleans, LaToya Cantrell (D), announced that  MARDI GRAS will go on for 2 solid weeks....COME ON DOWN...let's all have some FUN!!\n
      \n
      3/2/2020 - BOTH Cuomo and DEBLASIO said:   a news conference Cuomo and DiBlasio said: “We are no where in need of additional beds we have 1200 beds which we won’t need. Earlier Cuomo said “We have the best healthcare system in the world.” He went on: “80% of the people that have coronavirus will SELF TREAT and SELF RESOLVE and will be fine and think they just have the NORMAL FLU”. “The one case that tested positive is home and doesn’t need to be in a hospital..\n
      \n
      3/3/2020 - DeBlasio asks NEW YORKERS to IGNORE CORONAVIRUS and get on with their lives. He then suggested for New Yorkers to go to a movie.\n
      \n
      3/5/2020 -  DeBlasio says coronavirus fears SHOULDN’T KEEP NEW YORKERS off SUBWAYS…speaking from his ride on the subway he stated : "I’m here on the subway to say to people nothing to fear, go about your lives and we will tell you if you have to change your habits but that's not now."\n
      \n
      NOW, UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN, WEREN'T those POLITICANS, calling Trump names and undermining him, DEMOCRATS???\n
      AND\n
      UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN, ISN'T NEW YORK leading the CASES  and DEATHS from the corona virus?\n
      AND\n
      UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN, wasn't it ANDREW CUOMO the governor that DEMANDED that SENIOR LIVING CENTERS take in VICTIMS that had CORONA VIRUS which then caused THOUSANDS of DEATHS in those homes????\n
      \n
      JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE TIMELINES and WHO was BEHIND the SPREADING OF THE VIRUS.....\n
      AND\n
      LO AND BEHOLD...These are the SAME PEOPLE that belong to the SAME PARTY that is now claiming this on their LYING DEMOCRAT PARTY, FACEBOOK PAGE, the FOLLOWING STATEMENT:\n
      "TIME TO ELECT DEMOCRATS.  The astronomical UNEMPLOYMENT RATE and STAGGERING DEATH TOLL are a result of failed leadership. In the beginning, TRUMP DELAYED our nation’s response. Now, Mitch McConnell is DELAYING RELIEF. We need a change of leadership. In November, we’re taking back the White House and flipping the Senate. Add your name if you’re with us."\n
      \n
      THERE ISN'T ONE THING in that post that is TRUE...Just read every line carefully and tell me one thing that ISN'T AN OUTRIGHT LIE!!!\n
      \n
      YUP, as I've said many times..\n
      The DEMS have shown their TRUE COLORS and they are NOT RED, WHITE and BLUE!!!\n
      \n
      I think that after this election their colors will be BLACK AND BLUE!!!! American patriots will BEAT THEM TO A PULP......

      🇵🇹 300 Meals Daily for Lisbon, Portugal’s Homeless Population\n
      \n
      Due to the global health crisis 🦠🌎 É um Restaurante, a restaurant located in Lisbon, Portugal, closed its doors to the public. The closure, however, has not prevented this restaurant’s staff from displaying #SolidarityInAction by preparing and distributing 300 meals 🍲daily to Lisbon’s homeless population. The restaurant itself has a mission to #LeaveNoOneBehind by integrating individuals who have experienced homelessness into the labour market. Through this initiative, those who were once on the street themselves are now assisting those who remain on the streets.\n

      Happy 13th Birthday to Billy, Jr,, the son of Arms Wide Open's founders Dena Sherwood and Billy Sherwood. \n
      \n
      Billy is a 2x childhood cancer survivor and the inspiration for Arms Wide Open and The Truth 365. While he prefers to stay behind the scenes, Billy is involved in every aspect of the foundation and participates in all of our events and campaigns. \n
      \n
      Billy is an old soul with deep wisdom that defies his age. Cancer may have attacked his body but that only served to sharpen his mind and strengthen his faith. \n
      \n
      Although Billy loves the outdoors and is very active, his doctors have ruled out contact sports due to his spinal surgeries. Instead of focusing on athletics, he approaches learning like it's an Olympic sport, He is very passionate about education and is constantly training his mind like an elite athlete.  \n
      \n
      Billy is very close to the Lord and he pushes us to keep fighting for children and families in need.

Her name is Jill Murphy Walden and she single-handedly guided us through a make-or-break crisis in our earliest days of our campaign. Jill not only vouched for our credibility but she gave us great advice that we follow to this day. At the time Jill reached out to us, we were at a crossroads and had been praying for guidance. \n

      Jill has continued to support us over the years and we are very grateful. Sadly, the two amazing children who helped connect us with Jill have since passed away from childhood cancer. Talia Castellano passed away from neuroblastoma in 2013 and then her beautiful son Kellen died in 2017 after a 9-year battle with brain cancer.  \n

      "We are trying to help the girls see [the pandemic] as a unique situation that we can bond over and come out stronger in the end, just like we did with cancer!" -The Belshers  \n
      \n
      Tonight we are launching an awareness campaign that highlights childhood cancer families who are in social isolation during the current pandemic. \n
      \n
      We are taking family photos (from a safe distance) and asking them to share their perspective on how their childhood cancer battle prepared them for this current crisis. \n
      \n
      The goal is to raise awareness of childhood cancer and give hope to those who are struggling with the stress of the pandemic. Even though they are very different situations, there many similarities on a family-level and personal-level. \n
       \n
      We photographed three families today and we will expand the campaign in the coming days. We are initially calling it #ThePerseveranceProject but are open to suggestions on names. \n
      \n
      We will be featuring families with survivors, fighters and angels. We are starting in Northern Virginia but will expand once we work out the logistics. \n
      \n
      Our first family is the Belsher family from Virginia. \n
      \n
      Six years ago, little Sydney was diagnosed with Infantile Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia at 6 months old. She spent 2 years in treatment and was in the hospital or in isolation much of the time. At one point, her family had to move to Cincinnati, OH for 5 months because her doctors in her home state were out of options for her. \n
      \n
      Sydney is now doing very well and is socially isolating with her parents Carla and Brad, her big sisters Hayden and Kaylee as well as their dog Ajax. \n
      \n
      Here is Carla Dellamore Belsher in her own words…\n
      \n
      "Going into social isolation for the 2nd time in our lives has been quite a bizarre situation. In all honesty, I have moments of intense anger because it feels like we already "paid our dues" with 2 years of fairly intense social isolation while Sydney was on treatment.  I remember so vividly the first time we went to a restaurant with Sydney after 6 months of eating every meal at home or in the hospital and it felt like going to Disneyland!  Since she finished treatment, we have worked so hard to be grateful for all of the places we get to go and things we get to do as a full family of 5. And I hate that that gift has been taken away from us again unexpectedly.... \n
      \n
      Getting a cancer diagnosis takes away any level of control you thought you had in your life.  Nothing can be predicted, each day looks different, you can't plan anything in advance, and you live each moment in a fog of the unknown. And while we feel lucky enough to all have healthy immune systems in the house right now, this situation is mimicking the same types of feelings for all of us. Trying to explain all of this to a 6, 8 and 10yo feels very different than it did 6 years ago when we first embarked on our cancer journey. Sydney even cried uncontrollably one night fearful that if she got COVID it would make her cancer come back. We have fielded anxious questions, consoled them during nightmares, and tried our best to alleviate irrational fears.  Brad and I keep saying, though, we have done this before and we can do it again!  We are trying to help the girls see it as a unique situation that we can bond over and come out stronger in the end, just like we did with cancer!  \n
      \n
      All in all we have come together as a family and are really enjoying the slower pace of life right now, which we admittedly were not able to do during our first round of social isolation. Each night at family dinner we all say something we are grateful for that day.  We remind them how lucky we are to have a safe place to live, steady incomes, and healthy immune systems if they need to jump into action to fight this virus.  Brad and I have said repeatedly that our heart absolutely breaks for any family in the midst of active treatment right now.  The COVID fear laid on top of cancer is just unfathomable. Lean on each other for support (virtually!) and we will get through this together!”\n

Rata-rata orang di Indonesia menyumbang 300kg sampah makanan yang terbuang setiap tahunnya.\n
     \n
    “Banyak banget yaa. Dengan angka sebanyak itu, makanannya pada kemana sih?”\n
     \n
    Jawabannya adalah menjadi sampah, yang dikenal dengan istilah food waste. Sampah jenis ini jika tidak dikelola dengan baik dapat menghasilkan gas methana yang berpotensi menyebabkan ledakan.\n
     \n
    “Ledakannya besar Champ?”\n
     \n
    Dilansir dari lifestyle.bisnis.com, pada tahun 2005, sempat terjadi ledakan di TPA Leuwigajah, Cimahi, Jawa Barat. Ledakan ini menelan 157 korban jiwa dan 2 desa hilang tergulung longsoran sampah. Jadi, kamu bisa ukur sendiri seberapa besar ledakan yang dihasilkan oleh gas methana, hasil dari sampah makanan yang tidak terkelola dengan baik.\n
     \n
    Sebenarnya untuk meminimalisir food waste mudah saja kok #Changemakers. Mulai dari diri kamu sendiri aja dulu.

Sudah gitu, banyak sekali sampah plastik yang tidak didaur ulang sehingga berakhir di laut kita, sehingga membahayakan biota laut.\n
    \n
    Hal ini, secara tidak langsung dapat membahayakan kita jika mengkonsumsi hidangan laut. Dan ini berdasarkan sampel darah kering yang diambil dari kerang biru oleh Mark Browne. Seperti ditemukannya mikroplastik, atau sebuah potongan-potongan kecil plastik. Hal ini menggambarkan bahwa satwa laut secara tidak langsung membawa potongan-potongan plastik yang mana ketika kita konsumsi dapat membahayakan tubuh kita.\n
    \n
    Nah kalau menurut Champ, kita perlu banget mendapatkan edukasi yang memberikan pemahaman seputar sampah plastik dan bahayanya agar masyarakat sadar dan dapat mengurangi penggunaan plastik, yang sudah jelas sangat membahayakan, seperti yang dilakukan oleh WWF Indonesia.\n

    It was not until the middle of March 2020 that President Pandemic announced social distancing -- TWO WEEKS TOO LATE TO SAVE 90 PERCENT OF THE CURRENT DEAD! If Virus-in-Chief had announced a social distancing order ON OR BEFORE MARCH 2, coronavirus deaths would still be UNDER 10,000, and the economy would be intact.\n
    What Trump has done in the last five months merits a Congressman Adam Schiff "TOLD YOU SO" TOUR of all major networks, late night shows, and other info-disseminators.\n
    "Adam Schiff and His Colleagues Did Their Duty in the Trump Impeachment Trial" The New Yorker 1/25/2020\n
    "From the beginning and throughout the trial, Schiff urged senators not to lose sight of the bigger picture. Late on Thursday night, he noted that Trump’s effort to extort Ukraine wasn’t a one-off: it fit into a pattern of the President putting his own interests ahead of the country, a pattern that would continue if he were allowed to remain in office. “You may be asking, how much damage can he really do in the next several months until the election? A lot. A lot of damage,” Schiff said. “This is why, if you find him guilty, you must find that he should be removed. Because right matters. Because right matters and truth matters. Otherwise we are lost.” \n
    \n
    BUZZ KILL AFTER TRIAL: CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS, IS THERE A GAG ORDER?\n
    At the time when Congressional Democrats should have been most vocal, they hit the mute button, and they are allowed a mentally unstable pathological falsehood factory and disinformation station to dominate the minds of voters, and purge the intelligence community with little or no rapid retorts. If they are under the impression that "the American people know he's lying", I would snap back, "NO THEY DO NOT". NOT ALL VOTERS KNOW TRUMP IS THIS NATION'S NATIONAL SECURITY NIGHTMARE.\n
    \n
    AS A POWER OF ONE, CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS SHOULD HAVE BEEN BULLHORNS ATTACKING TRUMP'S FURTHER ABUSES AND DEFENDING WHISTLEBLOWERS. THEY DIDN'T BUT MUST START NOW.\n
    \n
    "Trump is busily inciting people across the country — and especially in swing states — to ignore public health guidance on limiting the spread of covid-19 and resume socializing and working in the riskiest of ways. Modeling masklessness, he welcomes any sabotage of orderly reopening. “The place is bustling!” he exulted, after Wisconsin’s Supreme Court struck down stay-at-home orders.\n
    \n
    Such recklessness, in defiance of his own administration’s guidance, risks igniting new waves of the disease. That could lead not only to thousands more deaths but also to further devastation of the economy. It’s not far-fetched to think that this blowback could arrive with the cooler weather next fall — just as people are voting in the presidential election."\n
    \n
    ESTABLISH, AMPLIFY, AND MAINTAIN NARRATIVES THAT ERODE TRUST IN TRUMP'S DISINFORMATION.\n
    One top list narrative must be Trump's consistent habit of committing acts of crime or wrong-doing to further his political agenda such as election and re-election. Since the 2016 campaign, Trump has openly accepted assistance from a foreign aggressor who was currently known at the time to be undermining the election process and was also directly involved in the Hush Money campaign felony - both of which were committed in an effort to win an election. His material lie about Trump Tower Moscow (not existing) factored into the result as well.\n
    \n
    In July 2017, Putin conspired with (or duped) Trump into amplifying a Russian fabricated conspiracy theory designed to blame and frame Ukraine for the 2016 election meddling, and a DNC server hidden in the same country. Biden was also added to the hit list as Trump recycled the 2016 Russian meddling strategy for 2020. The impeachment followed the discovery.\n
    \n
    Then Trump attempted to downplay, if not coverup, an inevitable pandemic with one primary motive; preserve his re-election prospects. His election oriented decision-making resulted in the worst and most deadly response to a pandemic that could have spared 90 percent of the current dead if his mind was not clouded with self-interest. Yes, America, tens of thousands died because Trump saw the pandemic as a threat to his re-election rather than a national security crisis he was duty-bound to address. \n
    \n
    THESIS OF NARRATIVE: TRUMP'S VIOLATION OF LAWS, INVOLVEMENT IN WRONG-DOING, AND SELF-CENTERED DECISIONS DURING A NATIONAL CRISIS WERE ALL MOTIVATED BY TRUMP'S DANGEROUS OBSESSION TO BE RE-ELECTED TO AN OFFICE HE IS TOO CORRUPT AND BLATANTLY UNQUALIFIED TO HOLD.\n

    “Congressional Democrats were upset that they were not consulted before the changes. Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said they would have to examine the details of the reorganization to “evaluate the wisdom of these cuts.”\n
    The National Counterterrorism Center “plays a critical role in fighting terrorism and keeping Americans safe,” Mr. Warner said, adding that “we need to make sure that it continues to work as Congress intended, regardless of what the acting D.N.I. decides to do while he’s temporarily in the job.”\n
    Representative Adam B. Schiff, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said that the center “was created in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks, and preventing another catastrophic attack remains among our nation’s most solemn obligations.”\n

    TIME FOR HOUSE TO REBUKE IF NOT CENSURE TRUMP FOR THE FOLLOWING: [rough draft]\n
    [FREQUENT PUBLIC DISCLOSURE (SHAMING( OF TRUMP CORRUPTION IS ESSENTIAL, AND WORTH A PRESS CONFERENCE. Many voters may not be aware that his actions are violations of law or unethical.] Otherwise, why would he stop?\n
    \n
    1. Liberal use of impeachable strategies described in Richard Nixon’s Article Two Number Six Impeachment, which states: “In disregard of the rule of law, [Trump] Nixon knowingly misused the executive power by interfering with agencies of the executive branch, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Criminal Division, and the [tampering and misrepresentation of the Mueller Report from the special counsel], of the Department of Justice, and the Central Intelligence Agency, in violation of his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\n
    In all of this, [Donald J. Trump] Nixon acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States.\n
    Wherefore Donald J. Trump, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.”\n
    2. Liberal use of impeachable strategies described in Richard Nixon’s Article Two Number Four of Impeachment, which states, “He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, in violation or disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens, authorized and permitted to be maintained a secret investigative unit within the office of the President, financed in part with money derived from campaign contributions, which unlawfully utilized the resources of the Central Intelligence Agency, engaged in covert and unlawful activities, and attempted to prejudice the constitutional right of an accused to a fair trial.” Or in the case of Michael Cohen, a just release from prison due to coronavirus concerns. Also, in the case of former Obama administration officials all of whom were authorized to unmask criminal Michael Flynn who was caught negotiating Russian sanctions relief for exchange of Russia’s successful assistance in the election of President Donald J. Trump - who was funneled stolen information from a political opponent through Roger Stone from Russian supported Wikileaks.\n
    3. Obstructing life saving measures prior to March 2: The last day before 9 of 10 coronavirus deaths were preventable. Trump canceled a critical World threat assessment scheduled for February 12. If Congress had received that assessment, tens of thousands of lives could have been saved.\n
    4. Ignoring the warnings of White House economists, intelligence briefings, and CDC personnel because their information threatened the stock market numbers and replace-election.\n
    5. Pre-meditated misuse of authority prefaced by firing DNI inspector generals so Trump could misuse his office to distribute money in an inequitable corrupt manner.\n
    6. Firing State Department Inspector General for investigating misuse of Human Resources by Pompeo.\n
    7. Inappropriate appointments of inexperienced and unqualified coronavirus supply distribution that was blatantly a Deep State crony driver favoritism scam that disproportionately favored Trump allies over state needs.\n
    8. The firing, censoring, and misrepresentation of CDC and other medical experts, which consequently endangered the lives of Americans for self-interests at odds with the reality of the crisis.\n
    9. Refusing to distribute the original CDC guidelines to open the economy with American lives as a priority over economy, and replacing the guidelines more amenable to economy over lives.\n
    10. Press conferences with frequent misrepresentations and disinformation that placed American lives in unnecessary risks.\n
    11. Endangering the lives of protesters, law enforcement, medical personnel, and government officials for self-serving political purposes.\n
    12. Placing this nation at risk by the purging and removal of experienced and qualified intelligence community personnel as a preface to abuse Presidential and DNI authority for self-interest and self-preservation purposes not related to national security of the United States. Attempting to restructure the intelligence apparatus in a criminally driven manner that places the United States in a compromised position against foreign aggressors.\n
    13. Misuse of Presidential authority and Attorney General authority to disrupt and deconstruct federal investigations related to the Russia investigation with a criminal effort to revise definitive conclusions and fabricate excuses for the release of criminal suspects or the removal of charges against Russian actors who meddled in the 2016 presidential election for self-serving purposes that were threaten the national security of the United States of America.\n
    14. Frequent use of impeachable actions described in President Richard Nixon’s articles of impeachment, which still merit impeachment. Misuse of multiple agencies to unjustly pursue fabricated violations in a manner identical to impeachable acts described in President Nixon’s articles of impeachment.\n
    15. A continued effort to suppress evidence that is disclosed in books, such as John, whose past due publication describes blatant acts of corruption that endanger the national security of the United States for personal and self-enrichment purposes. Such violations described include “doing favors for autocrats” by tampering with investigations related to the autocrat and Trump self-interests.\n
    16. The appointment of a completely unqualified inexperienced DNI with nefarious motives, which makes Richard Grenell the second most critical threat to national security (after President Trump. AG Barr is ranked third threat) since his acts confirm his gutting and reshaping of the intelligence community is analogous to Trump’s gutting and reshaping if the CDC which has resulted in a disastrous response accountable for tens of thousands of preventable deaths. \n
    17. President Trump should be reminded that impeachment of a President is not limited to one per term. Depending on 2020 election dynamics, continuance of Presidential misconduct could make a 2020 re-election success redundant if impeachable acts continue to accumulate.\n

    Right now, states are beginning to reopen, against the best recommendations of doctors, public health officials and other experts. State legislatures, governors, and the federal government are putting millions of people, especially the poor, at great risk by reopening too soon.

    \n
    Hundreds watched as the men incarcerated at the Mississippi State Penitentiary (Parchman) pled for their lives and for help as violence unfolded at the end of 2019. Videos were circulated that detailed the horrific conditions that exist at Parchman. Unfortunately, what we all witnessed is not an anomaly that is only taking place in Mississippi prisons. Prisoners in facilities across the U.S. are living in deplorable, unsanitary conditions without access to medical and mental health care. \n
    \n
    This in unacceptable under any circumstances but during a global health pandemic, these conditions are a potential death sentence. What is happening in Parchman is happening in other prisons across the state of Mississippi and across this nation. Parchman is everywhere. We hope you will join us to discuss these important issues. It is a matter of life or death.\n

With hundreds of thousands of displaced people living in crowded camps and a health system weakened by systematic attacks by the Syrian regime and Russia, an outbreak will be nearly impossible to contain. The prevention work being done by the White Helmets and other local groups in Idlib is crucial. \n

Our colleague Ameenah wrote: \n
    \n
    “I come from a big family and I remember all the times we were gathered at the table, being loud, laughing and talking at the same time. My mother is a great cook, she learnt it from her mother, and she would ask what everyone wished for and then cook dishes for all of us. Family for us was and still means everything.” \n
    \n
    “My uncle was the first one to go missing. One day his house was raided and he was arrested barefoot in his pajamas in the cold. We tried to stop the intelligence forces from taking him, but ended up being beaten up ourselves. That was only the beginning. My father, my brother, my other uncle, and many cousins were forcefully taken and disappeared into the detention centres of the Assad regime.”  \n
    \n
    “After six years we still know nothing about their whereabouts, but like all families we need to know what happened to our loved ones to be complete again. Now for me, a decorated dish of tabbouleh salad is horrifying and annoying. It is my brother Muhammad's favourite food, who has been detained for six years. “My mom's tabbouleh is the best in the whole world!” Muhammad always used to say. My mom tells me she won’t make it until he is back.” \n
    \n
    “I live in Berlin now and I am always on the lookout for those who have tasted loss – who might understand why I panic over fresh tomatoes and avoid buying parsley and smelling the ingredients of tabbouleh all over the house.”\n
    \n
    “It is too late to change anything in my story, but for so many families who are living through danger, trauma, and displacement, there is still a lot that can be done. For my family and so many Syrian families, we can’t change the past but we will always hold the world responsible until we have justice and accountability for our families.” \n

It hasn’t given health facilities in northwest Syria a single bed to receive coronavirus patients. We know there are logistical problems in receiving ventilators globally, but what about oxygen generators and patient beds?" \n
    \n
    "When the WHO makes promises to deliver aid to the people of Idlib, other donors think that they’re taking the lead. But after months of promises, the WHO hasn’t responded with a single dollar and they haven’t delivered any resources. The WHO has a real problem in northwest Syria.”\n
     \n
    Today Dr Munzer al-Khalil, the head of مديرية صحة إدلب - Idlib Health Directorate, delivered a stark message to the World Health Organisation in a webinar hosted by Chatham House and The Syria Campaign on the risks of coronavirus in Idlib. \n
     \n
    “Idlib has just 47 adult ventilators and they are 100% occupied most of the time. We don’t have one available ventilator that’s ready to receive corona patients, yet there is no clear deadline for when the WHO is going to deliver on its promises.”\n
     \n
    “The WHO is sending all their aid via the regime in Damascus, but we remember when the regime attacked our hospitals and killed our medical staff. We remember when it cut polio vaccinations for our children in 2012 so that polio would appear again in northwest Syria, as a weapon to punish people.”\n
     \n
    “We have a good relationship with our fellow doctors in Damascus and we know that there are a lot more coronavirus cases than the regime is publicising. There is no trust to work with the regime. If the WHO does want us to deal with Damascus, they have to be clear with us that that’s their plan, but they aren’t transparent and they don’t even tell us their plan.”\n
     \n
    Also on the panel was Raed al-Saleh, leader of the Syria Civil Defence - The White Helmets. He also criticised the WHO’s coronavirus response in Idlib:\n
     \n
    “The way the WHO delivers assistance is not impartial or balanced. They prioritise regime controlled areas. We aren’t against the WHO assisting our brothers and sisters in regime controlled areas, but we believe aid should be delivered on a needs basis and balanced across areas that need it.”\n
     \n
    “The bureaucracy of the WHO when it comes to emergency responses is a big challenge. The WHO announced a coronavirus taskforce for Idlib in early March, but we’re approaching the end of April and nothing practical has been delivered, while our people on the ground are waiting.”\n
     \n
    The webinar also covered the emerging risks to children in Idlib, laid out by Alaa Rajaa Mughrabieh from the  Syrian child protection network, Syria’s leading child protection NGO: \n
     \n
    “Children in North West Syria have already gone through so much. Prior to coronavirus, a million people, over half of them children, were displaced from their homes by months of intense shelling. Schools had only just opened again after the ceasefire when coronavirus emerged and schools had to shut again.” \n
    \n
    “There needs to be real investment in smaller organizations that are already operating successfully and which have built relationships of trust with their communities and authorities. Syrian civil society can produce results during and after an outbreak crisis.”\n

    \n
    The situation in Idlib has reached a horrifying level with close to one million people forced to flee Syrian regime and Russian bombs in just 40 day. Displacement camps along the border with Turkey are overcrowded and people are left with no option but to sleep in the open, in their cards on the roadside and in unfinished buildings. Several children have died in the cold.\n
    \n
    Assad’s and Putin’s forces continue to advance in the province, forcing residents to flee one village after another while claiming victory over the ruins of people’s homes. \n
    \n
    This is the biggest humanitarian disaster Syria has seen in the past nine years and it’s devastating every aspect of life for the 3.5 million civilians in Idlib. Just in February, nine medical facilities and three displacement camps have been deliberately targeted, which are clear war crimes. Schools have been forced to suspend their operations, putting half a million children out of school. \n
    \n
    Under the most dangerous conditions, the White Helmets continue to do everything they can to save every life they can. They have pulled 350 civilians from under the rubble since February 1 and helped evacuate hundreds of fleeing families to safer areas. \n
    \n
    Brave journalists and activists on the ground are sharing daily updates, calling on everyone to bear witness and to speak up for Idlib.\n
    \n
    In the face of this horror, the world's most powerful countries and institutions have utterly abandoned Syrian civilians. There is no plan for nearly 1 million displaced people who are squeezed into a shrinking area between the Turkish border and the front line as the regime continues to advance. \n

    “Once again, the Syrian regime bombs Idlib city, threatening the lives of millions of civilians. 12 people were killed and 22 others injured so far, by air raids that targeted the city center and the industrial zone. Our White Helmets teams continue their rescue operations.\n

    \n
    Fatima Haj Mousa, a journalist from Atareb who had to flee with her family last night, said: “Last night, Atareb was being bombed heavily by the regime and Russia, families were escaping on foot, motorcycles or in cars. The roads were also being targeted. Three people were killed and many injured on their way out. We fled our home and had to turn off our car’s lights so the warplanes won’t spot us. It was dark and really cold.”\n

    The situation in Idlib right now is the worst it's been in nine years. Syrian and Russian warplanes are bombing civilians in their homes and busy markets. They’re targeting the rescue workers who rush to carry the injured to safety and the doctors who treat them in hospitals. 200 airstrikes were launched in just 3 days. \n
    \n
    Tens of thousands of families are on the run. Their only hope is to reach areas near the border with Turkey, where they can take shelter in muddy tent settlements that are already stretched beyond capacity ten times over and struggling to cope with harsh winter conditions. But even the fleeing vehicles have been bombed on the road. \n
    \n
    The killing of children in their sleep and as they study, and of humanitarian workers as they save lives, has to stop and *can be stopped*. But those in power to stop the killing are turning their back on Syrian civilians as they have done for the past nine years, which is precisely why Assad and Putin continue to commit those crimes. They know there are no consequences.\n
    \n
    Let's raise our voices for our friends in Idlib. Here are five things each of us can do today to shine a spotlight on the crisis and demand action from world leaders to #SaveIdlib and protect civilians: https://diary.thesyriacampaign.org/what-you-can-do-for-idlib-2020/, https://www.facebook.com/607756062649744/posts/2804616139630381/), (2020-05-23, 78, INVALID, facebook, GOOD MORNING....this post is a little long, but says a lot...ALL FACTS with dates and well worth reading and passing on...\n
    \n
    I'VE NEVER BEEN ONE for CONSPIRACY THEORIES...\n
    BUT\n
    There are WAAAAAAAY too many COINCIDENCES so I'm going to CALL IT FOR WHAT I THINK IT IS...\n
    THIS was a WELL DESIGNED PLAN TO TAKE DOWN AMERICA, OUR PRESIDENT and US DOWN...\n
    AND\n
    If we were the DEMOCRATS COLLATERAL DAMAGE, that OK with them, \n
    AS LONG as they can BLAME TRUMP for the virus, say he didn't act fast enough, blame him for the recession and loss of jobs...THEY DON'T CARE....\n
    YOU WANT PROOF?\n
    If they cared, they would be on COMMITTEES to HELP OUR PRESIDENT, \n
    BUT\n
    instead, they just drool and FLAIL THEIR ARMS in the AIR, SCREAMING "THIS IS ALL TRUMP'S FAULT...YOU MUST VOTE FOR US in NOVEMBER!!!"\n
    THEY'VE DONE ZERO to help....ZERO!!!!\n
    \n
    REMEMBER,,,,this is JUST MY OPINION...I HOPE I'm completely and TOTALLY wrong!!!\n
    SO,\n
    I can only give you DATES and ACTIONS so YOU can make up your OWN MIND....\n
    \n
    Lets start with what country HATES AMERICA THE MOST?\n
    CHINA!  Our president has EXPOSED how they have "RAPED" America for DECADES on TRADE and, EXPOSED how BEHOLDING WE are to COMMUNIST CHINA.....\n
    THEN\n
    WHO HATES AMERICA NEXT AFTER CHINA?\n
    EUROPE....Our President ALSO EXPOSED how they have ALSO "RAPED" our country with UNFAIR TRADE DEALS....\n
    He's also pulled us out of the Paris Climate agreement, WHERE WE FOOTED MOST OF THE BILL and GOT NOTHING IN RETURN...\n
    HE also have made countries START PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE to belong to the UNITED NATIONS....\n
    THEY DON'T LIKE THAT EITHER!!!  THEY ARE REALLY TICKED OFF!!!!\n
    SO,\n
    BOTH CHINA and EUROPE have been SHAKEN TO THEIR CORE because TRUMP EXPOSED THEM...THEY WERE GETTING AWAY WITH MURDER for DECADES....\n
    OH, there are PLENTY of other countries that HATE US, COUNTRIES THAT WE GIVE BILLIONS of DOLLARS TO while they BURN our FLAG and CHANT "DEATH TO AMERICA"..\n
    AND THEY ARE LIVID that \n
    OUR PRESIDENT SAID:  "NOPE, NO MORE, NOT ON MY WATCH"!!!\n
    \n
    THE WORLD HAS BEEN HOPING for TRUMP to be TAKEN OUT OF OFFICE ever since won...They were actually rooting for the DEMOCRATS proving that Trump was a RUSSIAN AGENT and that he would be DRUG off to jail...\n
    WHY???  The reason is simple...\n
    THEY WERE PETRIFIED that HE would FOLLOW THROUGH with his campaign promises and DRAIN THE SWAMP...\n
    AND\n
    WHO WAS EVEN more PETRIFIED than the COUNTRIES of the world????\n
    THE DEMOCRATS!!!!\n
    SO, \n
    THAT TOOK 3 YEARS and MILLIONS of dollars, AND THEY FAILED....\n
    SO,\n
    THEIR NEXT STEP WAS IMPEACHMENT....WHICH ALSO FAILED!!!\n
    It's FUNNY HOW THAT WORKS when you have the TRUTH on your SIDE!!!\n
    \n
    We all have witnessed the ALMOST 4 YEARS of the DEMOCRAT PARTY do everything IN THEIR POWER to YANK TRUMP out of OFFICE....\n
    I don't need to go over ALL the times BECAUSE there are way too many and this column would be MUCH LONGER....\n
    BUT\n
    THAT ENTIRE, CORRUPT PARTY, along with MAXINE WATTERS was constantly screaming "IMPEACH FORDA FI, IMPEACH FORDA FI"...(Maxine's version of Impeach forty five)\n
    \n
    FACTS DON'T LIE!!!\n
    WE'VE all seen the HATE from the LEFT....the INTIMIDATION TACTICS THEY'VE USED....THEY NOT ONLY HATE our PRESIDENT, THEY HATE US FOR VOTING FOR HIM!!!!\n
     \n
    I've combined SOME of the dates from my post back in March and the dates AND ACTIONS that I posted 5/20 and it's all very telling... \n
    AND\n
    BASED on these dates, ACTIONS and WHO took those actions, my theory about this PANDEMIC has been reinforced MORE and MORE, EVERY SINGLE DAY...\n
    \n
    HERE IS A CURIOUS TIMELINE:\n
    \n
    12/18/2019 - President Trump was IMPEACHED..\n
    \n
    THINGS were GETTING VERY, VERY BAD in HONG KONG..\n
    THEN\n
     ABRACADABRA, \n
    12/31/2019 - The world health organization is INFORMED that people in WUHAN, CHINA, are coming down with pneumonia due to an UNKNOWN CAUSE.....\n
    \n
    1/3/2020 - CDC Director Robert Redfield sent an email to the director of the Chinese CDC, George Gao, formally offering to send U.S. experts to China to investigate the coronavirus. THEY REFUSED!\n
    \n
    1/5/2020 -  CDC Director Redfield sent ANOTHER EMAIL to the Chinese CDC Director, George Gao, formally offering to send U.S. experts to China to investigate the coronavirus outbreak, THEY REFUSED!\n
    \n
    1/8/2020 - "A Severe respiratory disease associated with a novel infectious agent" was proclaimed by Hong Kong's center for health protection....\n
    AND WHAT HAPPENED???\n
    Travel was RESTRICTED  in Wuhan, BUT ALLOWED THOUSANDS if not MILLIONS, corona virus  INFECTED humans were ALLOWED to COME TO AMERICA.....\n
    Now remember, the CDC TRIED TO SEND a TEAM to help 1/3/2020 and again 1/5/2020 and THEY REFUSED...\n
    WHY WOULD THEY REFUSE, you ask??\n
    SIMPLE, they didn't want the TRUTH to come OUT, that THIS VIRUS was MADE in their LAB....\n
    THEY NOT ONLY KNEW how CONTAGIOUS it was, BUT DIDN'T WANT HELP to STOP IT....THIS WAS THEIR ACE in the HOLE, in case Trump was ACQUITTED.....\n
    \n
    JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THESE DATES:\n
    \n
    1/14/2020 - W.H.O. said CORNAVIRUS was NOT CONTAGIOUS among HUMANS...\n
    \n
    1/30/2020 - BOTH Azar and FAUCI said the RISK TO AMERICA is low and people shouldn't be afraid of getting on a plane or going to the SUPERBOWL...\n
    \n
    1/31/2020 - IN SPITE of the W.H.O, Azar and FAUCI and IN SPITE of being called a RACIST and a XENOPHOBE by the DEMOCRATS, TRUMP announced CHINA TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS...\n
    Again, notice NO HELP FROM DEMOCRATS, just their NORMAL, CONSTANT NAME CALLING....\n
    \n
    2/4/2020- President Trump vowed, in his state of the union address to take ALL NECESSARY STEPS to protect AMERICANS from the CORONA VIRUS...\n
    \n
    For the ENITRE MONTH of FEBRUARY Trump worked endlessly to CURB the PANDEMIC....(see my previous post for exact dates WITH links to verify all dates)\n
    \n
    2/5/2020 - President Trump was ACQUITTED.....\n
    2/5/2020 - THE DEMOCRATS LOST THEIR MINDS.....AGAIN.....actually, WHAT'S NEW!\n
    2/6/2020 - THE DEMS were running around with their HAIR ON FIRE... ENDLESSLY BERATING TRUMP.....TRYING TO UNDERMINE EVERYTHING he was TRYING TO DO TO PROTECT US...\n
    AGAIN, what's new!\n
    \n
    2/24/2020 - Nancy DEMTIA-LOSI was in CHINATOWN telling people to COME ON DOWN...".It's SAFE,,,we are all here..so come on down and JOIN US...."\n
    \n
    2/25/2020 - Louisiana's Governor, John Bel Edwards (D) and the Mayor of New Orleans, LaToya Cantrell (D), announced that  MARDI GRAS will go on for 2 solid weeks....COME ON DOWN...let's all have some FUN!!\n
    \n
    3/2/2020 - BOTH Cuomo and DEBLASIO said:   a news conference Cuomo and DiBlasio said: “We are no where in need of additional beds we have 1200 beds which we won’t need. Earlier Cuomo said “We have the best healthcare system in the world.” He went on: “80% of the people that have coronavirus will SELF TREAT and SELF RESOLVE and will be fine and think they just have the NORMAL FLU”. “The one case that tested positive is home and doesn’t need to be in a hospital..\n
    \n
    3/3/2020 - DeBlasio asks NEW YORKERS to IGNORE CORONAVIRUS and get on with their lives. He then suggested for New Yorkers to go to a movie.\n
    \n
    3/5/2020 -  DeBlasio says coronavirus fears SHOULDN’T KEEP NEW YORKERS off SUBWAYS…speaking from his ride on the subway he stated : "I’m here on the subway to say to people nothing to fear, go about your lives and we will tell you if you have to change your habits but that's not now."\n
    \n
    NOW, UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN, WEREN'T those POLITICANS, calling Trump names and undermining him, DEMOCRATS???\n
    AND\n
    UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN, ISN'T NEW YORK leading the CASES  and DEATHS from the corona virus?\n
    AND\n
    UNLESS I'M MISTAKEN, wasn't it ANDREW CUOMO the governor that DEMANDED that SENIOR LIVING CENTERS take in VICTIMS that had CORONA VIRUS which then caused THOUSANDS of DEATHS in those homes????\n
    \n
    JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE TIMELINES and WHO was BEHIND the SPREADING OF THE VIRUS.....\n
    AND\n
    LO AND BEHOLD...These are the SAME PEOPLE that belong to the SAME PARTY that is now claiming this on their LYING DEMOCRAT PARTY, FACEBOOK PAGE, the FOLLOWING STATEMENT:\n
    "TIME TO ELECT DEMOCRATS.  The astronomical UNEMPLOYMENT RATE and STAGGERING DEATH TOLL are a result of failed leadership. In the beginning, TRUMP DELAYED our nation’s response. Now, Mitch McConnell is DELAYING RELIEF. We need a change of leadership. In November, we’re taking back the White House and flipping the Senate. Add your name if you’re with us."\n
    \n
    THERE ISN'T ONE THING in that post that is TRUE...Just read every line carefully and tell me one thing that ISN'T AN OUTRIGHT LIE!!!\n
    \n
    YUP, as I've said many times..\n
    The DEMS have shown their TRUE COLORS and they are NOT RED, WHITE and BLUE!!!\n
    \n
    I think that after this election their colors will be BLACK AND BLUE!!!! American patriots will BEAT THEM TO A PULP......, https://www.facebook.com/303061950155375/posts/912567755871455/), (2020-05-22, 78, POSITIVE, facebook, Best of luck to you in your campaign!

    🇵🇹 300 Meals Daily for Lisbon, Portugal’s Homeless Population\n
    \n
    Due to the global health crisis 🦠🌎 É um Restaurante, a restaurant located in Lisbon, Portugal, closed its doors to the public. The closure, however, has not prevented this restaurant’s staff from displaying #SolidarityInAction by preparing and distributing 300 meals 🍲daily to Lisbon’s homeless population. The restaurant itself has a mission to #LeaveNoOneBehind by integrating individuals who have experienced homelessness into the labour market. Through this initiative, those who were once on the street themselves are now assisting those who remain on the streets.\n

    \n
    Billy is a 2x childhood cancer survivor and the inspiration for Arms Wide Open and The Truth 365. While he prefers to stay behind the scenes, Billy is involved in every aspect of the foundation and participates in all of our events and campaigns. \n
    \n
    Billy is an old soul with deep wisdom that defies his age. Cancer may have attacked his body but that only served to sharpen his mind and strengthen his faith. \n
    \n
    Although Billy loves the outdoors and is very active, his doctors have ruled out contact sports due to his spinal surgeries. Instead of focusing on athletics, he approaches learning like it's an Olympic sport, He is very passionate about education and is constantly training his mind like an elite athlete.  \n
    \n
    Billy is very close to the Lord and he pushes us to keep fighting for children and families in need. There have been times in the last 10 years when Dena has mentioned spending less time on the foundation but Billy has always encouraged her to keep fighting for the children who are still in treatment or who have passed away. \n
    \n
    Like a diamond formed under great pressure, Billy has developed into a bright, unique and strong young man. We are all very proud of him and wish him the happiest of birthdays! \n
    \n
    Please leave a personal birthday greeting for Billy by commenting on this post!, https://www.facebook.com/445766622117719/posts/3407155829312102/), (2020-05-02, 78, NEUTRAL, facebook, For those of you on Instagram, The Truth 365 now has an active account @thetruth365film1.

    It is called "Persevere: The Weekly Wellness Challenge." Hannah and Ava are childhood cancer survivors and they know firsthand about being isolated and under quarantine. This video provides an overview of the campaign. \n

Her name is Jill Murphy Walden and she single-handedly guided us through a make-or-break crisis in our earliest days of our campaign. Jill not only vouched for our credibility but she gave us great advice that we follow to this day. At the time Jill reached out to us, we were at a crossroads and had been praying for guidance. \n
    \n
    Jill has continued to support us over the years and we are very grateful. Sadly, the two amazing children who helped connect us with Jill have since passed away from childhood cancer. Talia Castellano passed away from neuroblastoma in 2013 and then her beautiful son Kellen died in 2017 after a 9-year battle with brain cancer.  \n
    \n
    Our gratitude for Jill and her family cannot be measured. Although we can never repay her, we will always fight in honor and memory of Talia and Kellen. They are missed but will never be forgotten.\n

    This is a post from our 2013 Survival Games campaign that was based on The Hunger Games books and movies that were popular at the time. \n
    \n
    Then 12 years old, cancer survivor Gabi Shull said, "My hope in doing this Survival Games campaign is to raise awareness for childhood cancer so that there can be more funding for research. My hope is that one day there is a cure so that other children do not have to go through the pain and suffering that I went through. Children should not have to fight to survive. They should be able to live carefree childhoods.", https://www.facebook.com/445766622117719/posts/3328382190522800/), (2020-04-12, 78, POSITIVE, facebook, Cambri Update!

    \n
    Tonight we are launching an awareness campaign that highlights childhood cancer families who are in social isolation during the current pandemic. \n
    \n
    We are taking family photos (from a safe distance) and asking them to share their perspective on how their childhood cancer battle prepared them for this current crisis. \n
    \n
    The goal is to raise awareness of childhood cancer and give hope to those who are struggling with the stress of the pandemic. Even though they are very different situations, there many similarities on a family-level and personal-level. \n
     \n
    We photographed three families today and we will expand the campaign in the coming days. We are initially calling it #ThePerseveranceProject but are open to suggestions on names. \n
    \n
    We will be featuring families with survivors, fighters and angels. We are starting in Northern Virginia but will expand once we work out the logistics. \n
    \n
    Our first family is the Belsher family from Virginia. \n
    \n
    Six years ago, little Sydney was diagnosed with Infantile Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia at 6 months old. She spent 2 years in treatment and was in the hospital or in isolation much of the time. At one point, her family had to move to Cincinnati, OH for 5 months because her doctors in her home state were out of options for her. \n
    \n
    Sydney is now doing very well and is socially isolating with her parents Carla and Brad, her big sisters Hayden and Kaylee as well as their dog Ajax. \n
    \n
    Here is Carla Dellamore Belsher in her own words…\n
    \n
    "Going into social isolation for the 2nd time in our lives has been quite a bizarre situation. In all honesty, I have moments of intense anger because it feels like we already "paid our dues" with 2 years of fairly intense social isolation while Sydney was on treatment.  I remember so vividly the first time we went to a restaurant with Sydney after 6 months of eating every meal at home or in the hospital and it felt like going to Disneyland!  Since she finished treatment, we have worked so hard to be grateful for all of the places we get to go and things we get to do as a full family of 5. And I hate that that gift has been taken away from us again unexpectedly.... \n
    \n
    Getting a cancer diagnosis takes away any level of control you thought you had in your life.  Nothing can be predicted, each day looks different, you can't plan anything in advance, and you live each moment in a fog of the unknown. And while we feel lucky enough to all have healthy immune systems in the house right now, this situation is mimicking the same types of feelings for all of us. Trying to explain all of this to a 6, 8 and 10yo feels very different than it did 6 years ago when we first embarked on our cancer journey. Sydney even cried uncontrollably one night fearful that if she got COVID it would make her cancer come back. We have fielded anxious questions, consoled them during nightmares, and tried our best to alleviate irrational fears.  Brad and I keep saying, though, we have done this before and we can do it again!  We are trying to help the girls see it as a unique situation that we can bond over and come out stronger in the end, just like we did with cancer!  \n
    \n
    All in all we have come together as a family and are really enjoying the slower pace of life right now, which we admittedly were not able to do during our first round of social isolation. Each night at family dinner we all say something we are grateful for that day.  We remind them how lucky we are to have a safe place to live, steady incomes, and healthy immune systems if they need to jump into action to fight this virus.  Brad and I have said repeatedly that our heart absolutely breaks for any family in the midst of active treatment right now.  The COVID fear laid on top of cancer is just unfathomable. Lean on each other for support (virtually!) and we will get through this together!”\n
