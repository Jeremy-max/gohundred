For example, posts created by your followers that appear on your Facebook page would be considered Comments.</li>
                  <li><strong>Services</strong> means our websites, such as GoHundred (and all its current and future sub domains), and mobile applications, and any services that you access or purchase through our websites or mobile applications, but <strong>do not include</strong> Third-Party Services (see below for how we define those) that you access or use in connection with our services.</li>

If at any time a Social Network stops making some or all of its features or functionality available to us, or available to us on reasonable terms as determined by GoHundred in its sole discretion (each an “API Change”), we may stop providing access to those features or functionality and we will not be liable to you or any third party for any such change.</li>
